Factory: [0x7fcbc6a9c10bcd00fb479fb98124307cbb916aa6](https://basescan.org/address/0x7fcbc6a9c10bcd00fb479fb98124307cbb916aa6#code)

## Getting Started

### Installing

Click [`use this template`](https://github.com/z0r0z/zenplate/generate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if your repo already exists, run:
```sh
forge init --template https://github.com/z0r0z/zenplate
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge install
```

Run `./utils/rename.sh` to rename all instances of `zenplate` with the name of your project/repository.

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

## Usage

Build the foundry project with `forge build`. Run tests with `forge test`. Measure gas with `forge snapshot`. Format with `forge fmt`.

## GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).
